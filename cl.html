        <div class="introduce">Dear Hiring Manager,</div>
        <div class="introduce">
          I have been studying web develodivment for the divast few months. I am
          determined to specialize in React on the front end, Node / Express /
          MongoDB on the back end. I am comfortable with vanilla JavaScript,
          jQuery and Python and I will gladly and quickly learn any new
          technologies needed.

          About me: Few years ago I studied at HUST college. But due to some
          personal problem, I dropped out of college, and I always regret it.
          After that, I went to work a variety of jobs outside the tech world.
          While I continue to work, I am looking to enter the tech world â€“ I
          always enjoyed programming and look forward to working with it.
        </div>
        <div class="introduce">
          A few months ago, I started back to self-taught programming, with lots
          of online resources. I began the program at Free Code Camp and have
          finished their programs in Responsive Web Design, JavaScript
          Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Libraries, Data
          Visualization, APIs and Microservices, Quality Assurance, Scientific
          Computing with Python, and Data Analysis with Python. In addition to
          the expected work in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX, I also
          got to work with Bootstrap, React, Sass, D3.js, Node.js, Express,
          Mongo/Mongoose, Passport, and others.
